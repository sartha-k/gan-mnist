# MNIST Handwritten Digit Generation — GAN (PyTorch)

A Generative Adversarial Network built from scratch in PyTorch to generate realistic handwritten digit images. Unlike previous projects that classify images, this project **generates** new images from random noise — marking the transition from discriminative to generative modeling.

---

## What is a GAN?

A GAN consists of two networks trained simultaneously in opposition:

- **Generator** — takes random noise as input and generates fake images
- **Discriminator** — takes an image (real or fake) and predicts whether it's real

They compete in a minimax game:
- Discriminator tries to correctly distinguish real from fake
- Generator tries to fool the Discriminator into thinking its fakes are real
- Over time both improve until generated images are indistinguishable from real ones

## Dataset

**MNIST** — 60,000 grayscale handwritten digit images (28×28 pixels)

Images normalized to `[-1, 1]` using `transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))` to match the Generator's `Tanh` output range.

## Architecture

### Generator
Takes a **100-dimensional random noise vector** and upsamples it into a 28×28 image.

```
Noise (100,)
    ↓
Linear(100 → 128×7×7) → ReLU → Unflatten(128, 7, 7)
    ↓ (128, 7, 7)
ConvTranspose2d(128→64, 4×4, stride=2) → BatchNorm → ReLU   # 7→14
    ↓ (64, 14, 14)
ConvTranspose2d(64→1, 4×4, stride=2) → Tanh                 # 14→28
    ↓
Generated Image (1, 28, 28)
```

### Discriminator
Takes a 28×28 image and outputs a probability of it being real.

```
Input (1, 28, 28)
    ↓
Conv(1→32) → ReLU → MaxPool(2×2)
Conv(32→64) → BatchNorm → ReLU
Conv(64→128) → BatchNorm → ReLU → MaxPool(2×2)
    ↓
Flatten → Linear(128×7×7 → 1024) → ReLU → Linear(1024→1) → Sigmoid
    ↓
Probability (real or fake)
```

## Training Details

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Loss Function | BCELoss |
| Optimizer | Adam (both G and D) |
| Learning Rate | 0.0002 |
| Batch Size | 32 |
| Epochs | 150 |
| Latent Vector Size | 100 |
| Hardware | NVIDIA T4 GPU |

### Training tricks used:
- **Label smoothing** — real labels set to `0.9` instead of `1.0` to prevent Discriminator overconfidence
- **`detach()`** — fake images detached from Generator graph when training Discriminator to avoid double backprop
- **Separate optimizers** — Generator and Discriminator each have their own Adam optimizer

---

## Training Loop Structure

```python
# Step 1: Train Discriminator
loss_real = loss(D(real_images), real_labels)   # real → 1
loss_fake = loss(D(G(noise).detach()), fake_labels)  # fake → 0
loss_d = loss_real + loss_fake

# Step 2: Train Generator
loss_g = -mean(log(D(G(noise))))  # fool D → maximize D output on fakes
```

## Key Concepts Practiced

- **Adversarial training** — two networks with opposing objectives
- **ConvTranspose2d** — upsampling (reverse of convolution) for image generation
- **BCELoss** — binary cross entropy for real/fake classification
- **Label smoothing** — stabilizing GAN training
- **`detach()`** — preventing gradient flow between Generator and Discriminator updates
- **Tanh output + normalized input** — matching Generator output range to data range

## What's Next

**Transformers** — the architecture powering modern LLMs and vision models, and the foundation for diffusion models.
